// 1. Variables & Datatypes

// A. Q + A
// i. We assign a value to a variable by using 1 = sign
// ex. let x = 5;

// ii. We change the value of that variable by setting the
// variable equal to something else. Ex. let x = 5; to reassign it
// you could say x = "car";

// iii. Say we have 2 seperate variables, let x = 5; and let y = 10;
// If we change the value of x from 5 to 10, we can then write let x = y
// because they both have the same value

// iv. Declaring something registers a variable in its scope.
// Assigning something giving a variable a specific value 
// Defining something gives a variable its parameters

// v. Pseudocode is writing out what you want to do in plain text
// before you actually write the code. You should do it because
// it gives you direction so that you do not write a bunch of useless code

// vi. You should be spending 75-80% of your time thinking about how to solve
// the problem and 25-20% of your time typing the actual code

// B. Strings
// 1.
let firstVariable = "Hello World";
firstVariable = 5;
let secondVariable = firstVariable;
secondVariable = "Hulk Smash";
console.log(firstVariable);

// 2.
let yourName = "Steven";
console.log(`Hello, my name is ${yourName}`);
